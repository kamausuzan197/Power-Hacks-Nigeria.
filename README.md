# FORK A GITHUB REPOSITORY

Objective:

- learn how to fork and create a pull request on another repository

## Description

I believe your coding journey you've come across the term **`fork`** . If you've not yet, don't worry, this article will help you wit a step by step guide to navigate and fork your first repo!

As a developer this a very important tool that you'll be using to make open source contributions and also submittion of your code to a specified repo(We mainly use this for hackathon code submittions in Power Learn Project).

## Steps:

1. **Make sure you are logged in your github account**
2. **Click the github link you were given for submition** e.g https://github.com/kamausuzan197/Power-Hacks-Nigeria..git *This is the submision link that was used for the powerhacks nigeria*
3. **The link will redirect you to the github repo for submition**, go through the page and you'll find this icon written `fork`

click on it and you'll be redirected to create a new repo to store/upload your code that you will submit/upload to the original repository.

4. **After creating the repo, you can now clone it to your computer and write and push your code from it from your local comptuters IDE like vsCode**

5. **(Optional) Create a Branch**

Before pushing your code changes, it's a good practice to create a new branch for your project. This branch will be the basis for your pull request.
``` sh
git checkout -b YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```
Once you have made your changes, commit and push them to the forked repository.

6. **Create a Pull Request**

Now, you're ready to submit your code changes. Go to the original repository you forked from, and you'll see an option to create a pull request. Click on it, and follow the steps to submit your code changes.
